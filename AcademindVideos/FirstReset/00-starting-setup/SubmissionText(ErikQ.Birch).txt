8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
(I got through a lot of the videos and am catching up. I'm not going to skip videos by downloading a more recent updated code. Partly because I want to do better and understand, partly because I might miss a downloading step and would be stuck with no idea.S)

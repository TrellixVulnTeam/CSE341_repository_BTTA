After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
(NA)

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
(https://github.com/erikqb3/CSE341_repository.git)

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
(I have done two of the assignments from the videos; not the last one. I followed along with the video and now it
is funcioning. The nav works so I can go back forth beween 'Shop' and 'Add Product'.
I can also add product and form a list.)

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
(Need to touch up on some css and add images. Besides that, it is as functional as the video's.)

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
(I've learned more about how router.get works along with the functionality of req and res. Also am satsified to be working
with ejs and meshing javascript with html)

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
(I'd say maybe provide a "What do you do if this problem happens" resource; specifically when there are installation and terminal problems. 
That might be a bit much though.)

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
(4)
8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
(I could do more, but the amount of time it took to figure out problems has drained me. Despite this though, with the help of many others,
my code reliably does what it's limited options says it should do and therefore is enough for this week.)
